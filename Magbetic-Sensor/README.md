# This folder is dedicated to the programmes used for Magnetic Pole detection
Magnetic_v1 read from analog pin and convert the reading to actual voltage. Then, calculate the deviation from the bias voltage to classify the pole.

Magnetic_v2 sets the bias voltage during the setup so that it can calibrate before the detection. 

(Note: v2 is tested on Orangepip so the reference voltage, i.e. the maximum analogue read is 5V) need to be adjusted according to the specifications of the operating board)
