# This folder is dedicated to the code used for detecting radio signals
The file Radio_FFT_v1.ino contains the code for initial radio signal analysis that obtain peak frequency of the signal
Major drawbacks of this method are the detection is susceptible to noises, and the sensor is required to be directly above the lizard to receive the signal
