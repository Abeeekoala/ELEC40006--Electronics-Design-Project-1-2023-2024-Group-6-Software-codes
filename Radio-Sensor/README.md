# This folder is dedicated to the programmes used for detecting radio signals
Radio_FFT_v1 obtains the peak frequency of the radio signal via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. 

Major drawbacks of this method are the detection is susceptible to noises, and the sensor is required to be directly above the lizard to receive the signal
