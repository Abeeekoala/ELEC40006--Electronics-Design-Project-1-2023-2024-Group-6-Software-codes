# This folder is dedicated to the programmes for motor control
Motor_v1 can control the basic movements of the rover 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' for forward, left, backward, right movement in full speed.
Left and Right movements are rotations on the rover's axis, like a tank spining around.

Full speed rotation is too fast for accurate control, and more movements option is neededd for better maneuverability.

Motor_v2 add two keys 'q', and  'e' for forward left and forward right respectively. This mimics a real car's movement. Also we decarease the speed for left right rotations.
